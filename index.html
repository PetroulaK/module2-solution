    <div id="bg3"> White Chocolate contains no cocoa solids, just cocoa butter. 
Typically, white chocolate is flavoured with vanilla to give it a delicate, slightly floral flavour. As both vanilla and white chocolate have creamy undertones, it makes perfect sense that the two would go well together.
